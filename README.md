# MRDet

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.1** or higher.

MRDet is based on mmdetection. mmdetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the open-mmlab project developed by [Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/)

## Updates

v0.5.1 (20/10/2018)
- Add BBoxAssigner and BBoxSampler, the `train_cfg` field in config files are restructured.
- `ConvFCRoIHead` / `SharedFCRoIHead` are renamed to `ConvFCBBoxHead` / `SharedFCBBoxHead` for consistency.
